Computer Vision Strategy for DressUp
The goal of the CV module is to automatically extract structured attributes (gender, type, color, pattern) from fashion images. This is an offline pre-processing task, not a real-time one.

Proposed Pipeline
Image Sourcing:

Scrape e-commerce websites (e.g., Myntra, ASOS).

Use open-source datasets like Fashionpedia or DeepFashion.

Object Detection (Finding the Clothes):

Goal: Identify and crop the specific clothing item in an image (e.g., isolate the shirt from the background and the person).

Model: Use a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model (like YOLOv8) fine-tuned on a fashion dataset. YOLO is extremely fast and accurate for object detection.

Output: A cropped image containing only the clothing item.

Attribute Classification (Extracting the Metadata):

Goal: Take the cropped image and classify its attributes.

Model: Train separate, smaller classification models for each attribute. Using smaller, focused models is often more effective than one giant multi-label model.

Type Classifier: A model trained to predict "shirt", "pant", "dress", etc.

Color Classifier: A model trained to predict the dominant color. This can also be done with algorithms like k-means clustering on the pixel values.

Pattern Classifier: A model trained to predict "solid", "floral", "striped", etc.

Framework: Use a library like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch with a pre-trained base like MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet for high accuracy with good performance.

Implementation Steps
Setup: Create a separate Python environment for the CV tasks with libraries like tensorflow, opencv-python, ultralytics (for YOLO).

Data Annotation: If fine-tuning, use a tool like LabelImg or Roboflow to annotate a small dataset for your specific needs.

Training: Write training scripts for each classification model.

Inference Pipeline: Write a master script that takes an image URL or file, runs it through the YOLO model, crops the result, and then passes the crop to each classifier to get the final metadata.

Database Integration: The output of the inference pipeline (the image URL + its extracted metadata) is saved into your main product database, which the recommendation engine will then use.

This approach creates a powerful, automated system for building the high-quality, structured dataset that is essential for a great recommendation engine.
